# Facebook Login Data

The app stores your Facebook login data here so it can search Marketplace on your behalf.

**Setup:** Open the app in your browser and follow the on-screen guide. You only need to do this once (or again if your session expires).

## Security

- **Never share** the saved login file — it gives full access to your Facebook account
- The file is in `.gitignore` and won't be committed
- If you think it's been compromised, log out of Facebook to invalidate it
