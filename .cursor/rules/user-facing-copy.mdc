# User-Facing Copy

User-facing text must be **non-technical** (no jargon) while **keeping the app's theme and personality** (e.g. pirate theme).

## Rules

- **Preserve the pirate theme** in the UI: keep themed labels (TARGET_QUERY, PORT_CODE, LOOT FINDER, HEIST FAILED, TREASURE ACQUIRED, loot-map, Steal Score, Doubloons, etc.), status messages, button copy (BEGIN HEIST, TRY AGAIN), and loading/phase wording (Infiltrating, raid, loot, comps). Do not remove or "plain-ify" theme for the sake of accessibility alone.
- **No technical jargon** in instructions, docs, or error messages. Avoid: API, server, backend, port, session, cookie, debug, DEBUG, headed mode, persistent profile, endpoint, environment variable, JSON, etc. Use plain language for *instructions* and *errors* (e.g. "log in to Facebook in the browser window that opens", "We couldn't connect. Make sure the app is running and try again.").
- **Instructions** (README, cookies/README): step-by-step in simple language, no dev jargon. Theme/personality can still show in app UI copy.
- **Error messages**: say what went wrong and what to do, in everyday words. No technical jargon (no "selector", "DOM", "element", "timeout", "h1", etc.). The surrounding UI (e.g. "HEIST FAILED!", "TRY AGAIN") stays themed.

## When in doubt

- For UI labels, status, buttons, loading text: keep the theme.
- For instructions and error text: no jargon; would a non-technical friend understand?
