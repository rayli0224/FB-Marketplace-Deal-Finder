# Docker-Only Development

This project runs entirely inside Docker. **Never install dependencies locally.**

## Rules

- **Do not run `npm install`, `pnpm install`, `pip install`, or any package manager locally.** All dependencies are installed inside the Docker container via the Dockerfile.
- When adding a new dependency, add it to the appropriate manifest file (`frontend/package.json`, `requirements.txt`) and rebuild the Docker image with `docker compose up --build`.
- The Docker Compose volume mounts handle hot-reloading for source code — `node_modules` and `.next` live only inside the container via anonymous volumes.
- All commands (dev server, linting, tests) should be run inside the container, not on the host machine.

## Adding a Dependency

1. Add the package to `frontend/package.json` (JS) or `requirements.txt` (Python)
2. Rebuild: `docker compose up --build`
3. Do **not** run install commands on the host
