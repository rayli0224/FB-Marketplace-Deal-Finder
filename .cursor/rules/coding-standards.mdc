# Coding Standards

## Function Naming

- Function names must clearly communicate what the function does, even without context
- Names should be descriptive enough that a reader understands the function's purpose
- Avoid vague or ambiguous names
- Functions that attempt an operation that may fail should use prefixes like `try_`
- For extraction functions, follow the pattern: `_try_extract_<what>_<how>`
  - Example: `_try_extract_title_with_selectors`, `_try_extract_title_by_dom_structure`

## Function Size and Structure

- When functions become large or complex, break them into smaller helper functions
- Each function should have a single, focused responsibility
- Keep related functions together
- Main functions should orchestrate helpers rather than contain all logic

## Documentation

### Docstrings
- All functions should have docstrings explaining **what** it does and **how** it does it
- A plain description paragraph is sufficient — omit Args, Returns, and Example sections unless they add real value
- Do not assume the reader has context — docstrings should be understandable on their own
- **Do not reference other function names** — describe the behavior inline instead of saying "delegates to X" or "calls Y"
- Include implementation details that aren't obvious from reading the code
- Explain technical decisions or non-obvious patterns
- Be clear and comprehensive, prioritizing understanding over brevity

### Comments
- Remove comments that don't add value
- Comments should explain "why" or provide context, not restate what the code does
- Keep comments that explain non-obvious logic, important context, or design decisions

## Code Organization

- Prefer robust, maintainable solutions over fragile, clever code
- Use layered fallback strategies when dealing with unreliable external data
- Design for failure: assume things will go wrong and handle gracefully
- When choosing between performance and reliability/maintainability, prefer the latter
- Document significant performance trade-offs when they're made

## General Principles

- **Clarity over cleverness**: Write code that's easy to understand
- **Explicit over implicit**: Make intentions clear through naming and structure
- **Fail gracefully**: Handle errors and edge cases appropriately
- **Consistency**: Follow established patterns within the codebase
