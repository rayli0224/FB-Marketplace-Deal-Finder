# Frontend Conventions

## Import Paths

- **Always use absolute import paths** with the `@/` prefix
- Never use relative imports (e.g., `./Component`, `../Component`)
- Example: `@/components/search-form/MarketplaceSearchForm` instead of `./MarketplaceSearchForm`

## Component Abstraction

### When to Extract
- **Reusable UI patterns**: UI elements that appear in multiple places
- **Complex UI structures**: JSX sections over 20 lines with a clear purpose
- **Reusable interactions**: Components with their own state/behavior
- **UI primitives**: Buttons, modals, toggles, inputs

### Organization
- Reusable UI components go in `@/components/ui/`
- Domain-specific components go in subdirectories (e.g., `@/components/results/`, `@/components/search-form/`)
- Each component should have a single, focused responsibility

### Structure
- All components must have TypeScript interfaces for props
- Include docstrings explaining what the component does and how to use it
- Export both the component and its props interface

### Naming
- Use semantically clear names that describe what the component does or represents
- Avoid technical jargon or ambiguous terms (e.g., `OverlayPanel` instead of `Modal`)
- Names should be self-explanatory without needing to read the implementation
- Prefer descriptive names over generic ones (e.g., `SearchResultsTable` over `Table`)
