# implement

My goal in this session is to {{input}}

Here's how I need you to work with me:

## First Step: Create a Branch

Before any planning or code, create a new branch for this work.

- Branch name format: `{username}/{short-description}` (e.g. `rayli/add-compact-toggle`, `mirujun/fix-search-form`).
- Use the **current system username** as the prefix (from `whoami` or `$USER`) so it works for any developer, not a hardcoded name.
- The short description should reflect the goal (from {{input}}). Use lowercase, hyphens for spaces.

Create this branch from the current default branch (e.g. `main`), then continue with the plan.

## Overall Plan First

Start by giving me a high-level picture of what needs to be done.

Then outline a step-by-step plan.

## Incremental Steps

Do not move to the next step until I approve.

For code implementation, only implement one small section at a time.

Each section must be self-contained, minimal, and easy to review.

## Explanation Before Code

Before writing code, explain exactly what you will change or add.

Ask me clarifying questions instead of assuming details about the codebase or preferences.

## Strict Output Control

Never implement an entire file at once.

Only implement the smallest possible unit of code that matches the current step.

Wait for my explicit approval before continuing.

If you implement code without approval, I will ask you to delete it and start over.

## Code Implementation Rules

- Maximum 10-15 lines of code per step

- Each step should be a single, focused change

- Always explain what you're about to do before doing it

- Ask for confirmation before proceeding

- If you're unsure about anything, ask questions first
